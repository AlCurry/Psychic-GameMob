# Psychic-GameMob
### A letter is selected at random by the game and the user has 9 tries to guess it correctly
### Assignment 3, GWU full stack program, used html, js, bootstrap & css.

Modified Psychic-Game to accept input with an input text, rather than with keypress event, to support mobile touch screen devices.
